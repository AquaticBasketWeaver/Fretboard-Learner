### Fretboard-Trainer ###
Just a simple python3 commandline script that randomly picks a musical note, helpful for learning a guitar fretboard. 
To run it, just do (provided you have python3 installed):
> python fretboard-learner.py

# Typical Usage #
The typical usage is:
    - Run the script
    - Play the note that is displayed
    - If able to find that note, enter `c`, otherwise enter `w`.
    - Repeat until satsified, then enter `q` to finish. 
    - Some final stats should pop up at the end.

Although this is the typical usage, this program is pretty general and can be really used for any sort of excercise that you can think of. 

# Future #
At the moment this program is *extremely* rudementary, and was mostly born out of the fact that I didn't feel like making paper cue cards to practice notes on my guitar fretboard. I'll probably revisit this and add more to it in the future.
